<p>Our computational environments and infrastructure are growing more
powerful, more heterogeneous, and more complicated. Reproducibility
can be improved through practices and tools that 1) enable efficient
management of data and scripts while capturing the history and details
of changes and 2) facilitate executing analyses in a fashion that
supports inspection, comparison, validation, modification, and
re-execution.
<br>To become most effective, such solutions should consider all
stages of the scientific process, from planning the experiment and
collecting data to publishing the findings. We aim to assist the
neuroimaging community in improving reproducibility of their results
by <strong>Do</strong>ing</p>
<ul>
  <li>data conversion with minimal manual effort while establishing
    data provenance from the moment data are collected</li>
  <li>collection and analysis of data provenance throughout different steps of
    the scientific process</li>
  <li>(re)execution of (previous) analyses in a scalable and flexible
  manner by taking advantage of both existing infrastructure and new
  technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We strongly believe in the benefits of modular design,
  collaboration, and re-use. That is why, instead of developing a
  single monolithic platform to "solve all the problems", we are
  reusing and contributing to existing projects as much as possible.
  To that end, in the scope of this project, we actively maintain
  relevant software
  within <a href="http://neuro.debian.net">NeuroDebian</a> so that
  ReproNim and other projects can benefit from this turnkey
  platform. We also provided official Debian packaging for
  <a href="http://singularity.lbl.gov">Singularity</a> "scientific
  containerization" platform to make your research more flexible and
  reproducible. With our ongoing software and platform development, we
  aim to provide you with a collection of tools that are useful on
  their own even if you choose not to use the full suite of products.
</p>
<p>
  Currently we are focused on the following projects. You can help us
  by trying and starting to use them, contributing, or by sharing your
  ideas on how to improve them. We need your feedback (positive or
  negative) to make our projects most beneficial
  for <strong>your</strong> research.

    and <a href="https://github.com/ReproNim/reproin/blob/master/docs/walkthrough-1.md">procedures</a>
    for MRI scanning to allow for flexible, automated, and
    non-ambiguous conversion of all acquired MR
    data from original DICOM files to BIDS dataset(s)</li>

    <li>contribute to the development of
    the <a href="http://github.com/nipy/heudiconv">Heuristic DICOM
    Converter (HeuDiConv)</a> which provides us the base
    implementation platform</li>

    <li>integrate with "lab notebook" suites such

</ul>

<p>
  Automcatically converting all collected data to BIDS, while
  retaining all original DICOMs as well a clear association between

</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    validate and assess the quality of data acquisition by using
    the <a href="https://github.com/INCF/bids-validator">BIDS-validator</a>
    and <a href="http://mriqc.readthedocs.io">MRIQC</a> to detect
    possible problems with the design or acquisition in the earliest
    stages of a project and avoid many common mistakes stemming from
    manual data conversion and curation
  <li>
    automatically reconvert all collected data if relevant
    defects get detected in the conversion backend utility,
    if additional metadata stored in DICOMs is found to be necessary, or
    in order to confirm the reproducibility of the data itself
  </li>
  <li>
    make it possible to start data analysis immediately after
    collection using any of the BIDS-aware applications
  </li>
  <li>
	facilitate data sharing (private or public) and publication (data
	descriptor papers) since all data is immediately almost completely
	ready for sharing with a standardized file layout and annotation.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/myyoda">YODA</a> Principles</h3>

<p>YODA (YODA’s organigram on data analysis) outlines an approach for
  using version control systems such as
  <a href="http://git-scm.org">git</a>,
  <a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com">git-annex</a>,
  and <a href="http://datalad.org">DataLad</a> in a modular fashion to
  cover the entire life-span of a research project with reliable,
  non-ambiguous tracking and orchestration of all digital products of
  a study (e.g., inputs, code, outputs). Modularization facilitates
  the independent re-use of parts (e.g., the same data used across
  multiple studies, versions of a software library used repeatedly) in
  a manner that scales to dataset sizes found in cutting edge
  high-resolution neuroimaging research.</p>

<p>
  In the scope of the ReproIn project, having all data collected as
  DataLad datasets makes it possible to
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
	start changing and enriching BIDS dataset with information not
	available during scanning (condition onsets, dataset metadata,
	etc.) while allowing for subsequent updates and merges with new
	data coming from the scanner using standard Git mechanisms
  </li>
  <li>
	distribute data for curation and processing across available
	infrastructure while relying on git-annex to maintain information
	about data availability, and Git providing clear information about
	dataset version(s)
  </li>
  <li>
	annotate sensitive data files with metadata to automatically
	restrict their public sharing (e.g. original DICOMs, non-defaced anatomicals).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We also extend and contribute new functionality
  to <a href="http://datalad.org">DataLad</a> to facilitate
  VCS-enabled provenance tracing of execution and results:
	<ul>
	  <li>
		<strong><a href="http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/cmdline.html#reproducible-execution">run/rerun</a></strong>
	  (see <a href="http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/usecases/simple_provenance_tracking.html">DataLad
	  documentation on provenance tracking</a>)
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<strong><a href="http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/generated/man/datalad-addurls.html">addurls</a></strong>
		to produce DataLad dataset(s) from a set of structured data as
		in the <a href="https://github.com/ReproNim/simple_workflow">Simple
		Workflow</a> papers.</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You can adhere to YODA principles by making a better use of VCS in
  your research projects. Visit and contribute to

<h3><a href="https://github.com/ReproNim/NICEMAN">NICEMAN</a></h3>

<p>Neuroimaging Computation Environments Manager
  (<a href="http://niceman.repronim.org">NICEMAN</a>) is being
  developed to help researchers track and manage computation resources
  that they have available and to use them in a reproducible and
  scalable way. We aim for NICEMAN to</p>
<ul>
    <li>collect information about used resources&mdash;such as software packages
      (Debian, Conda, pip), VCS repositories (Git, SVN), containers
      (Docker, Singularity)&mdash;possibly enriching already
      collected provenance information (e.g., obtained
      from <a href="http://www.reproducibleimaging.org/describe.html">BrainVerse</a>,
	  <a href="http://reprozip.org">ReproZip</a>, or workflow
      engines).  We emphasize collecting an exhaustive amount of
      information so it could be sufficient to later automatically
      re-instantiate necessary components given just a
      specification.</li>
    <li>analyze collected information to answer questions like
	  <ul>
		<li>"Am I using the same software as in the original analysis?"
		<li>"What has changed?"
		<li>"Does a given environment satisfy the necessary requirements?"
	  </ul>
	</li>
    <li>(when feasible) adjust any given computational environment to
        satisfy the specified requirements, or just repopulate a new
      (Docker, Singularity, etc.) container which would.</li>
    <li>provide a uniform interface to a variety of computational
        environments (containers, cloud, etc.) for interactive
        sessions and scheduling of computational tasks while allowing
        for tracing of computational resources used by the
        computation.</li>
</ul>
