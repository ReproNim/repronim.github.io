                            <p>An increasing body of evidence point to some issues in reproducibility in biomedical or life sciences. The issue of lack of reproducibility has been now described in several scientific domains and for several years, raising concerns in the scientific community. ReproNim has developed a curriculum that will give researchers the information, tools and practices to perform repeatable and efficient research and a map of where to find the resources for deeper practical training. </p>
